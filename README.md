# scarlet-bundle-linux

Producer repository for the Linux userspace artifacts consumed by the
[Scarlet](https://github.com/petitstrawberry/Scarlet) operating system.

This repository hosts the Buildroot configuration, build scripts, and
runtime bundle manifests used to generate per-arch Linux root filesystems
and auxiliary user-space artifacts (Mozc, kvmtool, demo applications, SHV
guest kernel/initramfs) for Scarlet.

## Building artifacts via Nix

On a Linux host, Buildroot root filesystems can be built from the producer
flake:

```bash
cd producer
nix build .#rootfs-riscv64
nix build .#rootfs-aarch64
```

The resulting archive is available as `result/rootfs-{arch}.tar.zst`. Buildroot
produces Linux binaries, so macOS hosts must use a Linux remote builder or CI.
The derivations use fixed-output hashes: the first real build intentionally
fails with `lib.fakeSha256`, after which Nix prints the actual SHA-256. Paste
that value into the derivation's `outputHash` field in `producer/flake.nix`,
commit it, and rebuild to pin the artifact. Buildroot is not perfectly
deterministic; if a rebuild produces a different hash, treat the artifact as
superseded and update the pin.

## Bundle lifecycle split

| Bundle | Artifact | Updates when |
|---|---|---|
| `rootfs` | Buildroot minimal rootfs + config | Buildroot bump, base package set change |
| `apps-demo` | zathura / green / fbdoom binaries | demo app upstream change |
| `mozc` | Mozc server + dictionary | Mozc upstream change |
| `kvmtool` | kvmtool (riscv64 only) | kvmtool upstream change |
| `shv-guest` | guest kernel + initramfs for nested virt | guest kernel bump or rootfs refresh |

All artifacts for a given `vX.Y.Z` are attached to a single GitHub Release
tag. Daily snapshots roll under a separate `nightly` tag. See
[ATTRIBUTION.md](ATTRIBUTION.md) for the per-artifact license review policy.

## Relationship to Scarlet

Scarlet consumes bundles from this repository via `cargo-scarlet`. Every
bundle uses `kind = "archive"` layers pinned by URL and SHA-256 against
assets published on GitHub Releases, so clean Scarlet clones no longer
need to run Buildroot. The per-arch SHA-256 map lets a single `bundle.toml`
cover both `aarch64` and `riscv64`:

```toml
[[layers]]
kind = "archive"
url = "https://github.com/petitstrawberry/scarlet-bundle-linux/releases/download/v0.1.0/rootfs-{arch}-v0.1.0.tar.zst"
sha256 = { aarch64 = "sha256:...", riscv64 = "sha256:..." }
format = "tar-zst"
strip_components = 1
to = "/system/linux-{arch}"
```

The `sha256` placeholders in the current manifests are TODO markers. They
will be populated with real hashes when `v0.1.0` is cut (Step 5).

## Status

History extracted from Scarlet's `bundles/linux` (and its former
`tools/linux` location) via `git filter-repo`. Producer environment is
pinned via `producer/flake.nix` (Buildroot 2025.02.6 + nixpkgs). Archive-
kind bundle manifests are in place pending the first release. The manual
release pipeline is in place; nightly automation and legal-info collection
remain as follow-up steps.

## Cutting a release

1. Open the **Build release** workflow in GitHub Actions and run it manually
   with a version such as `v0.1.0`. The `architectures` input defaults to
   `riscv64,aarch64` and can be narrowed for a single-architecture rebuild.
2. The workflow builds each selected rootfs on a Linux runner. Its first Nix
   build discovers the fixed-output hash, updates the runner's temporary
   `producer/flake.nix`, and retries with the discovered value.
3. Each build uploads a versioned rootfs archive and a
   `manifest-<arch>.toml` fragment containing the GitHub Release URL and its
   `sha256:<hex>` value. The workflow creates a draft release with those files.
4. Review and merge the follow-up pull request that pins the discovered hash
   in `producer/flake.nix`. Use the manifest fragments to replace the matching
   TODO values in `bundles/rootfs/bundle.toml` as a separate release update.

For a local Linux rerun, use `scripts/bootstrap-hash.sh ./producer
rootfs-<arch>` to discover the fixed-output hash and
`scripts/compute-artifact-hash.sh <file>` to format an artifact hash for a
cargo-scarlet manifest.
